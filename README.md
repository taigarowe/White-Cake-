HALLELUJAH! Finally a moist white cake from scratch that doesn’t taste like cardboard.  I promise, this will be the best homemade white cake recipe of your life! It is soft and fluffy, while still being super moist. The balance of fluffy and moist is exactly perfect for how cake ought to be! It’s  full of buttery rich flavor. I’m so excited. You are going to love it too!
